# ActiveMQ
# This app supports multiple brokers - for example in a network of brokers.
# NOTE 1: the properties below MUST be entered in sequence, so that the first brokerHost
#  corresponds to the first brokerPort, brokerJmxPort and brokerName
# NOTE 2: brokerName is required for JMX-browsing, it corresponds to the brokerName set in: 
#  <broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core" brokerName="localhost" 
# in file ACTIVEMQ_HOME/conf/activemq.xml
# Default brokerName: localhost
# För exempel config av ActiveMQ kolla under src/environment/activemq/...
